# ⚛️React & 🔥Firebase chat App

Simple chat App made with React and Firebase. To send messages you've to login by Google first.

Also, you have to create a web project in your Firebase account, enable the login method, the Cloud Firestore database and update your Firebase app config into the *src/services/settings.js* on this part:

`export const firebaseApp = firebase.initializeApp({
  // Your config here
});`

Of course you're completely free to use it, make a PR and (if you want too) give me a star 🌟

Thanks!
